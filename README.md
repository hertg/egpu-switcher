## Description

The goal of this CLI is to lower the barrier for Linux users to
use their eGPU on the Linux Desktop. With the `egpu-switcher config`
command the user can choose their external GPU.
On every bootup the service will check if the eGPU is connected
and if so, make X.Org prefer it.

---

## Limitations

- No hotplugging is possible. Users still need to reboot their computer to connect / disconnect the eGPU.

---

## Requirements

- Running X.Org
- Thunderbolt connection to eGPU is authorized
- Necessary graphics drivers for eGPU are installed

---

## Installation

### Ubuntu (apt)

*The PPA is no longer maintained for now (see #90)*

### Arch (aur)

```bash
paru -S egpu-switcher
```

> :deciduous_tree::zap: Save time and energy by using the pre-compiled `egpu-switcher-bin` package

## Configuration

The config file is created automatically and can be found at `/etc/egpu-switcher/config.yaml`.
Below you can see an example of a configuration file, annotated with some notes.

```yaml
# the 'egpu' config is generated by 'egpu-switcher config'.
# you probably shouldn't change this manually.
egpu:
    driver: amdgpu
    id: 1153611719250962689

# OPTIONAL: how many times 'egpu-switcher switch auto' should retry finding the egpu.
# this can be helpful if the egpu takes some time to connect on your machine,
# the following values are the default, if this config is omitted.
detection:
  retries: 6
  interval: 500 # milliseconds

# OPTIONAL: if you want to execute a script after switching to egpu/internal.
# the values must be absolute paths to a shell script, this script will
# then be run with '/bin/sh $script'.
# 
# it is required that the script is owned by root (uid 0) 
# and has a permission of -rwx------ (0700), in order to
# prevent potential privilege escalation.
hooks:
  internal: /home/michael/tmp/internal.sh
  egpu: /home/michael/tmp/egpu.sh
```
