## Description

The goal of this CLI is to lower the barrier for Linux users to
use their eGPU on the Linux Desktop. With the `egpu-switcher config`
command the user can choose their external GPU.
On every bootup the service will check if the eGPU is connected
and if so, make X.Org prefer it.

> [!NOTE]
> No hotplugging is possible. Users still need to reboot their computer to connect / disconnect the eGPU.

## Requirements

- Running X.Org
- Thunderbolt connection to eGPU is authorized
- Necessary graphics drivers for eGPU are installed

## Installation

### Ubuntu (apt)

*The PPA is no longer maintained for now (see [#90](https://github.com/hertg/egpu-switcher/issues/90))*

### Arch (aur)

```bash
paru -S egpu-switcher
```

> [!TIP]
> :deciduous_tree::zap: Save time and energy by using the pre-compiled `egpu-switcher-bin` package

## Configuration

The config file is created automatically and can be found at `/etc/egpu-switcher/config.yaml`.
Below you can see an example of a configuration file, annotated with additional information.

```yaml
egpu:
    # the 'driver' and 'id' configs are generated by 'egpu-switcher config'.
    # you probably shouldn't change this manually unless you understand why.
    driver: amdgpu
    id: 1153611719250962689
    
    # OPTIONAL: do not load 'modesetting' in the egpu config
    nomodesetting: false

# OPTIONAL: how many times 'egpu-switcher switch auto' should retry finding the egpu.
# this can be helpful if the egpu takes some time to connect on your machine,
# the following values are the default.
detection:
  retries: 6
  interval: 500 # milliseconds

# OPTIONAL: if you want to execute a script after switching to egpu/internal.
# the values must be absolute paths to a shell script, this script will
# then be run with '/bin/sh $script'.
# 
# it is required that the script is owned by root (uid 0) 
# and has a permission of -rwx------ (0700).
hooks:
  internal: /home/michael/tmp/internal.sh
  egpu: /home/michael/tmp/egpu.sh
```

### Custom X11 config

Since version `0.20.0`, a custom x11 config template can be configured by creating a file at `/usr/share/egpu-switcher/x11-template.conf`. The default template is shown below, you can use it as a starting point.

```
# autogenerated by egpu-switcher
{{if .Modesetting}}
Section "Module"
    Load           "modesetting"
EndSection
{{end}}

Section "Device"
    Identifier     "{{.Id}}"
    Driver         "{{.Driver}}"
    BusID          "{{.Bus}}"
    Option         "AllowEmptyInitialConfiguration"
    Option         "AllowExternalGpus" "True"
EndSection
```

> [!TIP]
> For safety, and to stop egpu-switcher from printing warnings, the file should be owned by `root:root` and have a mode of `644`.
